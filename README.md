Escaping Toro Sanctum(ETS) is a text-based adventure game that lets the user choose their own path with varying outcomes. The story takes place on an island in which the player searches for a missing team. The latest version of ETS is written with Pygame, while the older versions meant to be played directly on a terminal.
