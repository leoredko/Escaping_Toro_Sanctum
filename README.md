# Web Repo
This repo was created to be able to host our game (Escaping Toro Sanctum) on github pages and have a website for the public to access our capstone project that we created for  Justice through Code.
It's written in html and Css.
It includes the groups bio, game page, main page, and a page to thank our mentors.
